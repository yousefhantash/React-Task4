# 📅 Todo list

The To-Do List project is a React-based application that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. It features functionalities for adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks, all of which are stored locally using the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after the browser is closed or refreshed. The project leverages React hooks like useState and useEffect for state management and side effects, respectively, allowing dynamic interaction and a smooth user experience. The inclusion of unique task identifiers via uuid ensures that each task is uniquely identifiable, facilitating operations like editing and deleting. The application's clean and intuitive interface makes it easy for users to stay on top of their tasks and boost productivity.


## ⭐ Features

- Users can quickly add new tasks to the list, ensuring nothing gets overlooked.
- Tasks can be edited in case of mistakes or changes, allowing for easy updates.

- Mark tasks as completed with a simple click, visually distinguishing between completed and pending tasks.
- Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed, keeping the list clean and organized.
- The app saves tasks to the browser's localStorage, so tasks remain even after closing or refreshing the browser.
